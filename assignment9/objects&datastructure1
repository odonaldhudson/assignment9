Question 1:

The first example code will return false because you can not use "==" when you are not comparing primitives. 
The value of the "Q" may be the same as "name", but where they are stored are not the same.
The second set of code will return true because when they comparing using "char ch = name.charAt(0);"
which is the primitives and not the object references.
